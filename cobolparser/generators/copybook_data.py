"""Synthetic test-data generation from a COBOL copybook layout.

Turns a copybook (or the record layouts of a full program) into a CSV of
generated rows: one column per elementary field, one row per generated
record.  Values honour each field's PICTURE category, size, digit counts,
sign, ``USAGE``, ``VALUE`` clause, and any level-88 condition values, so a
generated row is always assignable to the record it was generated from.

Typical use::

    from cobolparser.generators import (
        CopybookDataGenerator,
        DataGeneratorOptions,
    )

    generator = CopybookDataGenerator(DataGeneratorOptions(rows=100, seed=7))
    dataset = generator.generate_from_file("CUSTOMER.cpy")
    print(dataset.to_csv())

Generation is deterministic for a given ``seed``: the same seed and the same
copybook always produce byte-identical CSV.  When no seed is supplied one is
drawn at random and recorded on :attr:`GeneratedDataset.seed`, so an
interesting run can always be reproduced after the fact.

Design notes
------------

* **REDEFINES are excluded by default.**  A redefining item aliases the same
  bytes as the item it redefines, so emitting both would put two
  contradictory values in one row.  ``include_redefines`` opts in anyway
  (useful when the redefinition is the layout you actually care about).
* **OCCURS are expanded** into one column per occurrence, named with the
  COBOL subscript convention (``ITEM-CODE(1)``, ``ITEM-CODE(2)``, ...).
  ``OCCURS ... DEPENDING ON`` uses the maximum bound.
* **Edited pictures** (``-ZZ,ZZ9.99``) contribute their *logical* numeric
  value, not the edited display form.  A CSV is consumed by tooling that
  wants the value; the edit mask is a presentation concern of the COBOL
  program.
* **FILLER is skipped** by default -- it names no field a consumer can use.
